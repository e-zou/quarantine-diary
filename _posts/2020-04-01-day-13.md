Dear Diary,

Today's weather was really nice and I got to play tennis with Jialin and Abhi. It felt good to be outside and being abl eot tell time with the sun rather than with the computer screen. As I was bouncing the neon tennis ball, I couldn't help but feel like I was back in high school again. I felt alone but not lonely. It also felt amazing to use these muscles that I haven't in awhile. A lot of my serves ended up hitting the net even though I was using dead balls. I can't say the same for my backhand though...

Even though I had partially reverted on my progress yesterday by going to sleep too late, I work up around 9:30am anyways. I used the morning to finish up homework and tried out online Zumba. I liked how I was able to do be silly and do alternative moves such as holding water bottle as weights. I didn't like the lag in latency or small audio. Overall, I think I'll do it again because it was fun.

I did continue with doing 100 wall push-ups though. When I tried to do a regular push up, I could lower myself a little bit more than before, before I fell down. Another personal achievement is that a few of my friends left really nice comments on my Instagram post. It makes me wonder if I really have the skills to make money off of photography in the future?


Sincerely,

Emily
