Dear Diary,

I spent most of today editing photos for my friend, Naomi. I intended to only edit a couple, but since she requested so many different poses, I felt obligated to edit them, too. Either way, I think it is a nice gift for graduation. As for the other few hours, I spent it trying to complete instagram challenges. I posted a photo of 5-year-old me, did some voice impressions, and did a badminton shot. I had great fun tagging all different friends. What else? I ended up binging some snacks at night while on FaceTime with Ashley. I'm so glad that I ended the night with her, because otherwise I would have had a completely boring day by myself. I never realized how much I need social interactions until these few days without my housemates or family around. Time just seems to move slower.

I really should have done my homework, but I finished the hard stuff, so it should be doable tomorrow. I kind of hate my Mondays and Wednesdays because I have 3 classes Ugh. 

Sincerely,

Emily
