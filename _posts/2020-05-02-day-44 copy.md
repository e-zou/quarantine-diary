Dear Diary,

I got up early in the morning to clean up my mess so that Ashley and Mom wouldn't have to do it. It was really nice having some human interaction again. I think having another person around helped me distract myself from dark thoughts. Automatically, I felt lighter and more capable to do things. I feel like if I'm going to live alone in the future, I will need a pet or something else to keep me feeling alive. 

Surprisingly, Mom was in a good mood, so she didn't end up ranting about the normal things. Instead, she was really sweet and helpful. She talked a lot, but I get it. I've been alone for awhile, and not talking to anyone has really gotten me feeling bottled up. Every time I talk to my sister, it feels like I just explode in words. It makes me sad that my mom doesn't have any friends her age here.

Sincerely,

Emily
