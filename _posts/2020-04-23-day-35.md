Dear Diary,

I finally did some of the things that I dreaded doing such as washing the dishes, grocery shop, and coding. I knew it was going to be a lot of work, so why did I leave it off for so long? I feel like there has to be something more efficient for me to work off of! I end up absorbed in one problem for way too long and lose track of time. I think I will start using pencil and paper to draw and plan out where I'm stuck and actually use shorter breaks in between for me to think with more clarity.

On the bright side, I am feeling awfully tired even though it's only close to 1am. I haven't been writing entries for three days, so that's why I'm staying up so late. Anyways, putting my phone in another room really is quite effective for helping me go to sleep early. 


Sincerely,

Emily
