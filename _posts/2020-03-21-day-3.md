Dear Diary,

Today, I went to play badminton outside with a couple of friends. It was really nice because all of us could stand far apart and be able to
hit the birdie. It was really fun and I got to use my arms and legs in a familiar way. After that, I invited them home and we played a little
bit of board games. I actually felt a little bit weird about it because we are all supposed to be social distancing. Then again, I think it 
will be okay since none of us have been to crowded places. I'm definitely worried and careful.

Also, I had a surprisingly decent conversation with a stranger on the internet in the middle of the night. It turns out we are really similar
in terms of personality, style, profession, and things we are inspired by. It's a really cool feeling to find someone you can vibe with. It 
reminded me of how I became friends Arisue. 

Sincerely,

Emily
