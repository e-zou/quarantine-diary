Dear Diary,

After having a great week of consistent exercise and sleep, I started to feel random salt cravings and sluggish. Lo and behold! My period started today, rendering me feeling all sorts of uncomfortable. Anyways, I spent today just trying to calm my mind and resetting myself. It was also really nice because I got to Zoom call with Apop and other badminton friends. 

Sincerely,

Emily
