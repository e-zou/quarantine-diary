Dear Diary,

I regressed a little bit of my progress. I should really use a timer to make sure that I tasks that I need to be doing. Instead of working on things that I need to be doing, I ended up wasting the day away. I don't even really know what I spent it on except that the day just passed by.

On a happier note, I did do another 100 wall push-ups and they are getting easier for me. That's exciting! I also took a slight nap today, which was really great. For some reason, reading the news just made me really sad today. It feels weird how the world has suddenly changed and now I'm stuck inside...

Overall, I need to stick to my schedule and stop coding so much. I end up watching and trying a lot of different things, but I barely make any progress anyways. I might as well just spend time working on some other stuff for a bit before coming back. I think I got too used to scrambling to get assignments that I didn't understand done that I don't even realize that I'm missing out in the real world. 

I feel so unaccomplished that I think I will write a list of what I want to do tomorrow- which will definitely be exhausting. 

Sincerely,

Emily
