Dear Diary,

I spent most of the day working on PHP, AJax, and SQL for my databases class. I easily lost track of time like usual, but it was alright in the end. At least I tracked a bunch of time on Forest. After planting my first tree, just a few days ago, I'm able to purchase another tree. I'll probably buy a fake one instead because I found out that the limit was 5 per person. 

Also, I challenged myself to continue the Chloe Ting Ab Challenge. It went so well. I feel amazing! There were moves such as the up-down planks and bunny hops that I had so much trouble with in the beginning, but now I have an easier time doing them. I'm glad that unlike Blogilates, she has the same videos over and over, so it's really easy to feel the progress and track how much I've improved. Overall, I've become used to sitting down. I'm not really sure if this is the best, but I have a lot of final projects to get done...


Sincerely,

Emily
