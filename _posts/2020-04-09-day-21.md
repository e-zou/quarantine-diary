Dear Diary,

I spent my day reading Howl's Moving Castle. The book is definitely different from the movie, but charming and whimiscal nonetheless. I enjoyed reading about Sophie's family and her own character grow into someone who is unafraid to explore the world. Perhaps it's because I am also the eldest and about to go into the real world, that I can relate to her well. I feel trapped by my circumstances sometimes, and it felt nice knowing that maybe I do have some magic in me. In addition, it makes me wonder about the kind of guy I'll fall for in the future? Certainly, having a dramatic but sweet husband like Howl will be a handful to deal with. Of course, I'm not sure about having husband or care too much if marriage happens or not. If I do fall in love, however, I do want to get married eventually. 

I digress. Anyways, today was a slow day. I barely wanted to get out of bed. I think I got used to having company around me, and this is just me unconciously grieving or adjusting. Although I do love reading, I feel like I should have spent my time doing something better like going out to take a walk? 

Sincerely,

Emily
