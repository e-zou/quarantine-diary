Dear Diary,

I was a bit sore from yesterday. I think I slept too late and it was raining in the morning, so I decided not to go out. After clambering out of bed, I danced a little, drank some coffee, then finished some poetry work. I know it's so bad and I'm supposed to pay attention to class, but I was really not feeling it. I took the whole day to just write poetry. Overall, I think I did pretty well. I think I just need some more time to revise.

Sincerely,

Emily
