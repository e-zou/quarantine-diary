Dear Diary,

I have no idea, but I keep craving salty things even though I've been drinking so much salty liquids from Miso and ramen soup lately. Woosh and it's all gone! Anyways, I spent today doing nothing even though I did wake up early. I think it could be just mindset hindering me from achieving more. Anyways, gan ba te! I shall aim higher tomorrow. Also, I spent a long time crafting my poem, which everyone seemed to enjoy even though it was super trippy.


Sincerely,

Emily
