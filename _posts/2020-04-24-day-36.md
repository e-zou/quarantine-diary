Dear Diary,

I spent the whole day perfecting my instagram and working on projects. Hopefully people enjoyed my content. Well, not to boast, but Dean J and UVA featured me, today. In addition, a few students sent in their questions to me about BACS. It's really awesome! I've been afraid of statistics because I wanted to keep my instagram personal, however, it's nice to see what other people like and what holds people's attention. From a psych perspective, it's really fascinating!


Sincerely,

Emily
