Dear Diary,

I spent most of the day cleaning with Ashley. We swept the floors, cleaned the fridge, and wiped down most of the surfaces. Despite how much I had already cleaned before she got here, there was still so much work to be done. 

In the afternoon, I took Ashley to sit with me on the lawn. We spent around two hours laying down and enjoying some sunshine and fresh air. I ended up reading some books that I haven't had time to enjoy and she played on her phone. We also packed a bunch of good food such as cucumbers, grapes, pistachios, chicken, asparagus, and sunflower-buttered toast. Overall, it felt nice to be outside after staying inside for so many days.


Sincerely,

Emily
