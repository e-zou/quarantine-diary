Dear Diary,

After having a good day yesterday, I failed to have a good one today. I got caught up with school work and ended up not exercising. This in turn gave me too much energy and caused me to stay up late. I think I tried to take a walk and eat some lunch on Grounds but that ended up being a fail because over Easter Sunday, UVA had put up new signs enforcing social distancing.

Sincerely,

Emily
