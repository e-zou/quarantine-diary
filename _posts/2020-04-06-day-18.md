Dear Diary,

Today, I spent most of my day listening to lectures and finishing up poetry. In the evening, I ended up buying some groceries for Ashley and I. We also rearranged and wiped some cabinets to make sure everything made sense. We found around 10 boxes of pasta that my roommates left. Now, we just need to eat pasta every day. Yay? 

Sincerely,

Emily
