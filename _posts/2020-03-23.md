Dear Diary,

I am not doing well. After a few days of isolation and online class, I have began to feel even more dread and incompetency. What am I going to do after graduation? Would people think of me differently for not going to grad school? Will I even talk to a lot of my friends after graduation? What am I going to do? 

I think getting two bad grades from two different classes tanked my mood. Honestly, I think the stress of cramming before spring break, spring break packing, the lack of friends around, the lack of exercise, and being on my period has made me moody and breakdown a lot. Perhaps it's also just me coming to the realization that no, I am not suited for or want to be a software engineer. I can't believe I spent four years working towards a degree that I can now understand, but has made me miserable. 


Sincerely,

Emily
