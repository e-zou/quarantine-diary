Dear Diary,

The day started out well emotionally. I was still very on edge today, but I was more forgiving towards my mood. Instead of pressuring myself to do everything, I just let the day happen. Of course, it was nice because I also limited my time on social media and staring at all the other fun things people are doing. I tried to take some quarantine pictures, but I just wasn't feeling great and didn't want to spend hours moving around and testing shots. Instead I started editing some hiking and UVA pictures that I took during the past two weeks. 

During the afternoon, I boiled a whole box of pasta, one of the ten boxes in the cabinet. Honestly, I don't think I can eat anymore of them or finish them by the end of the semester. There's just too much food left in my fridge to devour now that mom gave me even more stuff to eat. UGH. I quite enjoy grocery shopping, so that's out of the equation. Anyways, after doing nothing in particular for most of the day, I was finally motivated to do some work because Elise invited me to work with her. Even though we set the timer for three 30-minute sessions, I used one to nap and two to exercise and shower. Regardless, my mood significantly improved afterwards. Hopefully my abs won't be too sore from Chloe Ting's ab challenge. 

Sincerely,

Emily
