Dear Diary,

Today, I woke up at 9:30am! It's such a accomplishment waking up early after nearly two weeks of sleeping late and waking up late. It felt nice to have extra hours to relax and do nothing in the morning so when 10am comes around, I'm actually ready to do something productive.

Instead of working on projects and important career-related work, I spent my Sunday relaxing and do long-term things that I haven't done in a long time such as reading and writing careful letters to poetry classmates. I walked to the Lawn in something cute and just enjoyed the sunshine and watched the clouds move. 

At the end of the day, I got to chill on FaceTime with my sister and have a good laugh. It was really nice, and I think she will come over on Thursday. 

Sincerely,

Emily
