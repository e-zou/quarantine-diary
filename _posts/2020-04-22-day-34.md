Dear Diary,

I woke up late today, but I did start the day productive. I'm also happy that my teeth are staying straight, too. Anyways, I made a lot of yummy food today. For example, I made some Tamagoyaki, bagel sandwich, and more! I'm really enjoying these healthy snacks. (Plus, I've found out that non-dairy cheese tastes really similar to real cheese.)

I'm ready to takeover instagram for WiCS tomorrow! I made a lot of cute graphics. It kept me sane throughout the day as I was working on interactive tech and my database project. Good stuff.

Sincerely,

Emily
